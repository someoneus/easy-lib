# Booting up the Library
Before you can do anything you need to put this on the first line of your script!

`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/someoneus/easy-lib/refs/heads/main/source.lua"))()`

# Creating a Window
This window is the main frame that puts all of your components together!

`easyCreateWindow("Title")`

The first argument is a title string, put any string there and it will become your title


# Creating a Tab
A Tab is like a room to your components, splitting them into groups

`easyCreateTab("TabName")`

The First argument is the Tab name put any string there and it will become your Tab name

# Creating a Button
I made this one very easy to use for you

```easyCreateButton({
    Name = "Click",
    Callback = function()
        --The function that takes place when the button is clicked

    end
})```
